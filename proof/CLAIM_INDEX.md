The measure and crossing claims were initially downgraded because the scripts'
symbolic checks did not establish them. Their concrete measure, CDF, and
positive-transport core is now Lean-checked. PO-0023/0024 derive the
coordinate normalizers and strict positivity, and PO-0030/0031 use them to
construct the actual probability measures. PO-0038 identifies the
independently expanded paper object with the actual expectation difference,
and PO-0039 identifies that difference with the checked CDF integral. The
surrounding claims remain below `FORMALLY_PROVED` until the upstream
curvature-coordinate map discharges their remaining generic hypotheses.
