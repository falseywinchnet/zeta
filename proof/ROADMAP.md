# Proof roadmap

## Track A — readable closure

1. Normalize each paper claim into one atomic proof obligation.
2. Expand every inferential “because” in stable section frames.
3. Split algebraic identities from analytic well-definedness and strictness.
4. Complete the non-vacuity ledger for every target-reachable hypothesis.
5. Mark every leaf as definition, conventional proof, certificate, import,
   formal theorem, or gap.

Exit gate: the graph is precise enough that no Lean declaration needs to guess
what theorem it is meant to prove.

## Track B — analytic foundations

1. Choose the primary definition of `Φ`.
2. Prove local uniform convergence of the theta series and all derivatives
   required by the target path.
3. Prove theta transformation, even continuation, and equality of kernel
   formulas.
4. Prove `Φ > 0` before defining `log Φ`.
5. Formalize the change from the `t` coordinate to the curvature coordinate on
   its image, without claiming unused surjectivity.

Exit gate: every derivative, logarithm, inverse, and integral in the generic
and instance layers is well-defined.

## Track C — generic determinant engine

1. Formalize ordered nodes and translation minors.
2. Prove the quotient determinant identity for general dimension.
3. Prove the iterated quotient-integral identity with exact orientation.
4. Prove one-sided and two-sided confluent divided-difference limits.
5. Formalize quotient/Wronskian identities through order four.
6. Prove that strict positivity of the final derivative factor transfers to
   every distinct-node minor, with positive-length integration domains.

Exit gate: the local-to-global engine contains no Riemann-kernel estimate.

## Track D — exact sign certificates

1. Specify canonical inputs for `q`, `F₂`, and `C₄`.
2. Port or verify the polynomial/Bernstein/tail certificates inside Lean.
3. Prove that checked cleared numerators have positive denominators and equal
   the target invariants.
4. Independently formalize the rational finite PF5 witness.

Exit gate: certificate success entails the exact Lean propositions used by the
assembly theorem, not merely matching script output.

## Track E — transport and crossing

1. Prove triangular formulas for `Λ` and `δ`.
2. Prove normalization of `μ` and `ν` from those formulas.
3. Prove `ν((z,w]) > 0` from positive density and `z < w`.
4. Prove the density ratio formula, endpoint limits, and unique crossing.
5. Prove the CDF gap is strictly positive on `(p,w)`.
6. Prove the transport expectation identity and CDF integration by parts.
7. Derive the positive integral and `∂ξΨ < 0`.

Exit gate: no positive symbol or probability measure is introduced before its
positivity or total mass is derived.

## Track F — Lean 4 build

1. Lean/Lake/mathlib are pinned at `v4.32.0`; the project and dependency
   manifest now exist.
2. Maintain the exact resolved mathlib commit in the trusted-base ledger.
3. Add modules in dependency order: `Definitions`, `Theta`, `Determinants`,
   `Quotients`, `Signs`, `Curvature`, `Transport`, `Crossing`, `PF4`, `PF5`.
4. Add checks for `sorry`, `admit`, undeclared axioms, unsafe theorem bridges,
   and target drift.
5. Record `#print axioms` for exported theorems.
6. Rebuild from a clean environment.

Exit gate: T1–T3 are kernel-checked and the target-reachable graph has no gaps.

## Priority order

The first deep proof task is the generic iterated-integral engine, because it
is reusable and isolates finite-minor strictness from Riemann-specific
analysis. The first adversarial task is the `S09` crossing frame, because the
current symbolic derivative check is far weaker than the claimed stochastic
ordering. The first certificate task is statement reconstruction for CERT12,
not a rewrite of its generator.
