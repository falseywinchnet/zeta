## Typed edges

- T3 `because` T1, T2, and the definition of exact PF order.
- T1 `because` PO-0042 and PO-0043.
- PO-0042 `because` PO-0041 and the strict local-to-global direction of
  PO-0020.
- PO-0041 `because` PO-0026, PO-0027, and PO-0040.
- PO-0040 `because` PO-0029, PO-0037, and strict integral positivity.
- PO-0039 `because` common total mass, `A₀'=D`, and compact-support
  integration by parts. Its transport-weight specialization is checked
  independently of PO-0038.
- PO-0038 `because` PO-0029 and PO-0030–PO-0031.
- PO-0037 `because` PO-0032–PO-0036.
- PO-0030–PO-0031 `because` PO-0023–PO-0025.
- PO-0029 `because` PO-0013, PO-0022, and PO-0028.
- PO-0026–PO-0027 `because` PO-0010, PO-0015, PO-0021–PO-0025.
- PO-0020 `because` PO-0014–PO-0019 and lower-order positivity.
- lower-order positivity `because` PO-0011–PO-0016.
- PO-0011–PO-0013 `because` PO-0008–PO-0010 and CERT12 statement bridges.
- PO-0008–PO-0010 `because` PO-0001–PO-0007.
- T2 `because` PO-0044–PO-0045 and CERT17 statement bridge.

## Deliberately non-reachable refinements

- unique positive zero of the order-five confluent coefficient;
- outermost finite-spacing center;
- continuous PF4 Fourier separator;
- RH-related transform conclusions.

They remain separate claims and cannot make the core proof easier by lending
their conclusions backward.

## Current unresolved leaves

1. Lean/mathlib toolchain and exact formal statement representation.
2. Formal analytic construction and differentiation of `Φ`.
3. Formal statement bridges for CERT12 and CERT17.
4. Instantiate the maintained first/second quotient sign conversions with the
   actual Riemann-kernel `q>0` and `Lambda>0` inputs.
5. Exact bridge from the conditional maintained `Ψ` derivative assembly to
   positivity of the terminal quotient derivative, with the actual-kernel
   inputs and `p₄<p₃` orientation.

PO-0026 through PO-0028 and PO-0037 through PO-0039 are `FORMALLY_PROVED`.
PO-0029, PO-0040, and PO-0041 are checked conditional cores, not completed
actual-kernel obligations. Every route to T1–T3 still has unresolved
prerequisites. The fixed-order generic PO-0017/0018/0020 engine, its
translation quotient object layer, and the first two sign-conversion
mechanisms are checked. Their actual-kernel analytic inputs, the terminal sign
bridge, and certificate statement bridges remain unresolved.
